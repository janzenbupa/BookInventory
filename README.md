# BookInventory
This is a book inventory console application built with c++ and Sql Server. The application connects to a database which holds Book and Author information and then performs
different kinds of logic on the data. The data will be outputted to the console for the user to view.
To connect to the database I am using SQLAPI++. It is c++ library which allows for database connections.
